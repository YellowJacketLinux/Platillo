Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs
=====================================

Unicode `U+1F300` through `U+1F5FF` is frequently used for color SVG glyphs,
including several Emoji glyphs. In Platillo, all glyphs are monochrome
PostScript outline.

This block primarily is intended for use cases where color glyphs are not
desired and until a graphic artist adopts this font as a pet project (I am
__not__ currently seeking one), population of this block will be very slow and
initially, it will primarily used for cases where compatibility support for
8-bit bitmap Cairo, 8-bit bitmap Taliesin, 8-bit Webdings, and the three 8-bit
Wingdins fonts have glyphs that meet the assigned Unicode definition in this
block.
