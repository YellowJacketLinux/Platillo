Platillo
========

Currently this repository holds SVG files for my future use in a ‘Pi Fonts’
for various Unicode blocks that are generally not language specific.

Platillo is a name I would like to reserve for *my* packaging of the glyphs.

At this time I am not seeking contributions.

Eventually the glyphs will be imported into a Fontforge where they can then be
packaged as an OpenType font using PostScript outlines (cubic Bézier curves).

The font will *probably* be released under the ‘GUST Font License’ (GFL) and
so that license applies to this repository in the present.

See the file `GUST-FONT-LICENSE.txt` and `LPPL.txt`.
