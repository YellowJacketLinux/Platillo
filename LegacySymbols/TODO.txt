185 of 212 (87+% done) of code-points in the block are done.

The segmented digital numbers may need baseline adjustment.

None of the glyphs have yet had import into FontForge attempted.

Also, in September Unicode 16 is coming out with a supplemental block using the
range `U+1CC00` to `U+1CEBF` adding LOTS of additional legacy glyphs.

Work on those glyphs is being done in the ‘LegacySymbolsSupplement’ `git`
branch.
