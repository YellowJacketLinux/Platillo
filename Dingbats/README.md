Dingbats
========

This block covers `U+2700` through `U+27BF` for a total of 192 glyphs. Most of
the glyphs in this block are recreations of the glyphs in the 8-bit PostScript
font ‘ITC Zapf Dingbats’ but it should be noted that some of the glyphs in this
block are *not* from that font and similarly, some of the glyphs in that font
are in other Unicode blocks.


ITC Zapf Dingbats and Metric Compatibility
------------------------------------------

The glyphs that are recreations of the glyphs in the 8-bit PostScript font ‘ITC
Zapf Dingbats’ are not metric compatible with the 8-bit PostScript font except
possibly by pure accident. I have no plans to recreate these glyphs with metric
compatibility.

If you need metric compatibility in a Unicode font, you can probably use the
OpenType font ‘ITC Zapf Dingbats Std’ which is at least *mostly* metric
compatible if not fully metric compatible. It is a commercial font with a (IMHO)
horrible licensing scheme. The various free downloads that exist appear to
either be illegal (the code is under copyright) or have restricted use for
viewing only. I believe ‘ITC Zapf Dingbats Std’ is freely available in the Adobe
Acrobat 5 download but I believe with usage restrictions. I *think* modern
versions of Adobe Acrobat provide these glyphs in a font called ‘Adobe Pi Std’
and that too may have metric compatibility, I just do not know.

There may exist a metric compatible Unicode version of this font that is based
upon the code in the free URW clone of ‘ITC Zapf Dingbats’.

For a metric compatible 8-bit version of ‘ITC Zapf Dingbats’, the URW clone that
is part of Ghostscript (and is part of CTAN/TeXLive) can be used.
