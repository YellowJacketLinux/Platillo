Dingbats
========

This block covers `U+2700` through `U+27BF` for a total of 192 glyphs. Most of
the glyphs in this block are recreations of the glyphs in the 8-bit PostScript
font ‘ITC Zapf Dingbats’ but it should be noted that some of the glyphs in this
block are *not* from that font and similarly, some of the glyphs in that font
are in other Unicode blocks.

The glyphs that are recreations of the glyphs in the 8-bit PostScript font ‘ITC
Zapf Dingbats’ are not metric compatible with the 8-bit PostScript font except
possibly by pure accident. In the future, I do plan to recreate those glyphs
with metric compatibility but it is a soft plan, meaning I would have to be
really bored out of my wits first. If you need metric compatibility, you can
probably use the OpenType font ‘ITC Zapf Dingbats Std’ which is at least
*mostly* metric compatible if not fully metric compatible. It is a commercial
font with a (IMHO) horrible licensing scheme. The various free downloads that
exist I do not believe are legal.

Work on this block will take place in the ‘ZapfDingbats’ git branch until all
glyphs in the 8-bit PostScript font ‘ITC Zapf Dingbats’ have coverage.
