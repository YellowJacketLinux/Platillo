Cairo and Taliesin
==================

In the early days of bitmap fonts on the Apple Macintosh, Apple had two picture
glyph fonts created by Susan Kare called ‘Cairo’ and ‘Taliesin’.

Cairo was there from the beginning, I believe Taliesin came with QuickDraw and
was later renamed to ‘Mobile’

My Platillo font will have glyphs reminiscent of the glyphs in those fonts,
within the Unicode PUA range of `U+E800` to `U+E8FF`. Both will fit within that
256 code-point range.

It will likely take awhile, first I have to create ‘pseido-bitmap’ templates
that I can then trace once I decide upon the metrics, and except where the
original glyphs are too generic in nature, the glyphs have to have some visual
distinction from Susan Kare’s creation.
