Miscellaneous Symbols
=====================

This block covers `U+2600` through `U+26FF` for a total of 256 glyphs. Some of
these glyphs are recreations of glyphs in the 8-bit PostScript font ‘ITC Zapf
Dingbats’ but most are not.

The glyphs that are recreations of the glyphs in the 8-bit PostScript font ‘ITC
Zapf Dingbats’ are not metric compatible with the 8-bit PostScript font except
possibly by pure accident.

Work on this block will take place in the ‘ZapfDingbats’ git branch until all
glyphs in the 8-bit PostScript font ‘ITC Zapf Dingbats’ have coverage.
